## Summary {#summary}


### Eat That Frog {#eat-that-frog}

> If the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog,
> you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is
> probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.

Eat That Frog essentially offers a new way of living in order to fight procrastination.
This being eating the frog of the day first thing, every morning.
The frog here represents the most important task of the day that will provide the greatest
positive result. It is also often the "ugliest" task. Meaning it is hard, un-enjoyable, boring and anxiety inducing.
This frog first approach is a very powerful idea, since the frog, even though the most valuable, is the task one is most likely
to procrastinate on.


### The 80/20 Rule {#the-80-20-rule}

20% of your tasks account for 80% of substantial results for a project/goal.
This 20% is often more difficult, perhaps more time and energy consuming.
These tasks are the frogs.
By starting with the frogs, you get the most value out of your time spent.
Tackling the bulk 80% of tasks one ends up burning through time and gets nothing done.

This is often how one procrastinates without realizing. They spend their time
working on the 80%. They expand energy and effort but get little to nothing accomplished.

> One of the very worst uses of time is to do something very well that need not be done at all.


### Causes of Procrastination {#causes-of-procrastination}

The two major causes of procrastination:

-   **Lack of clarity**, the task is vaguely defined, making it difficult to approach.
-   **Lack of self confidence**, the task is beyond our skill level, we are less likely to approach tasks
    that we think we will fail at.


### Tools to Fight Against Procrastination {#tools-to-fight-against-procrastination}


#### Planning {#planning}

Plans significantly cut down the amount of time spent during execution and provide vision/clarity.

-   **Think on paper**. Write everything down.
-   Plan each project/life goal carefully.
-   Make lists of all the sub-tasks that will be required to start and finish a project/goal.
-   Make deadlines for yourself and hold yourself accountable.


#### Lists for Everything {#lists-for-everything}

Lists give you a starting point and a way to track your progress increasing clarity by a great deal.

-   Make a list for the activities of today, this week, this month.
-   Always add tasks to the task list before completing them. Always keep the list up to date.
-   **Use the ABCDE system** to prioritize tasks
    -   _A_: tasks with concrete consequences on career/social life
    -   _B_: tasks with mild (often social consequences)
    -   _C_: tasks with little to no consequences (not related to work career)
    -   _D_: tasks that can be delegated
    -   _E_: tasks that can be eliminated/discarded
    -   Always start with A tasks
-   Take tasks from monthly and weekly lists and add them to today as fit.


#### Thinking Long Term {#thinking-long-term}

Long term thinking and positive visualization of who one wants to be, will make them
motivated to complete the tasks that bring them closer to their goals.

-   **Engage in long term thinking**. It is simply a fact of life that people who
    think long term are more likely to be successful.
-   **Write your future goals down**. (Goals for the next 5-10 years).
-   Visualize who you would like to be in the future and plan your tasks/goals/projects accordingly.


#### Overcoming Self Doubt {#overcoming-self-doubt}

Self doubt and fear of failure are great contributers to procrastination.
Fight against your inner perfectionism.

-   Increase your skill set. Constantly look for areas where you can improve your
    skills in the fields that you want to work on.
-   Draft your work. **Accept that your first attempt might not be perfect**.
    Make peace with the idea of failure, but hold yourself responsible to come back
    and fix it over and over until you achieve your goals.
-   **Just start**. The greatest resistance is often at the begging.
    Once you start, you will begin to build momentum and the task will become a lot easier.


#### Flow {#flow}

Flow is the king of productivity.

-   Act fast. Move from problem to problem.
-   **Set yourself smaller, digestible goals**, as you finish them you will build momentum.
-   **Momentum is the key to flow**, as you complete more tasks, quickly
    entering flow will become easier.
